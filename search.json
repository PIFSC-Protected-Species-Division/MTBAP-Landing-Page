    "text": "Who We Are\n\n\n\nMTBAP Area of Research\n\n\nThe Marine Turtle Biology and Assessment Program (MTBAP) conducts research throughout the Pacific Ocean to support the conservation and management of threatened and endangered sea turtle populations.\nWe study sea turtle species that live in the North Pacific Ocean during one or more life stages, from hatchling to adult. This includes green, loggerhead, olive ridley, leatherback, and hawksbill turtles—all protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.\nOur work is guided by species-specific recovery plans and conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, other agencies, and community partners. The knowledge we generate informs management decisions and drives conservation actions across the Pacific Islands Region.\n\n\n\nWhat We Do\nOur primary goal is to understand, assess, and monitor sea turtle populations in the Pacific to support management needs and recovery goals mandated by the Endangered Species Act and other federal statutes.\nWe achieve this by:\n\nConducting field and laboratory research to investigate sea turtle health, ecology, and life history\n\nDesigning geospatial models that integrate population, ecological, satellite, and climate data\n\nProviding data streams, research infrastructure, and scientific leadership across the Pacific\n\n\n\n\nAreas of Research\nOur projects focus on the biological health, ecology, and threats to sea turtle populations, including:\n\nPopulation abundance estimates across Hawaiʻi, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and other U.S. Pacific Territories\n\nClimate change effects on sea turtle populations and their habitats\n\nMovement patterns and habitat use\n\nFisheries impacts and bycatch reduction\n\nGenetic diversity and stock structure\n\nHealth consequences of tumor-forming diseases such as fibropapillomatosis\n\nPhysiology and resource requirements\n\nBehavioral responses to human-made noise\n\nImpacts of biotelemetry devices\n\nNesting and foraging ecology\n\nThreat assessments across life stages\n\n\n\n\nSuccess Story: Green Turtles in Hawaiʻi\nOne of the clearest examples of conservation impact is the recovery of the green turtle, or honu, in Hawaiʻi.\nWhen our studies began in the 1970s, green turtle populations were severely depleted. Today, thanks to decades of conservation regulations and informed management, our monitoring data shows that Hawaiʻi’s honu are steadily rebounding and are now commonly seen in coastal waters.\n\n\n\nRescue and Rehabilitation\nSince 1990, our team has worked with non-profit, community, and educational partners to rescue, rehabilitate, and release over 1,000 turtles throughout the Hawaiian Islands.\nThe most common causes of stranding are:\n\nFibropapillomatosis (tumor-forming disease)\n\nFisheries interactions (entanglement in fishing line or nets)\n\nInjuries from boat strikes or shark attacks\n\nThrough rescue efforts, we not only save individual turtles but also collect valuable data on the threats affecting sea turtle populations.\n\n\n\nPartnerships\nPartnerships are a fundamental component of our work and essential to the success of sea turtle research throughout the Pacific.\nWe collaborate with:\n\nU.S. federal and state agencies\n\nLocal non-profits and community groups\n\nEducational and cultural organizations\n\nInternational partners and regional networks\n\nThese relationships strengthen conservation outcomes and extend the reach of our science.\n\n\n\nBy the Numbers\n\n\n\nSea Turtles Studied by MTBAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n5 sea turtle species studied in the North Pacific\n\n50+ years of long-term monitoring\n\n1,000+ turtles rescued and rehabilitated\n\nResearch conducted across Hawaiʻi, Guam, CNMI, American Samoa, and other U.S. Pacific Islands\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nBy studying population dynamics, evaluating threats, and supporting rehabilitation, MTBAP ensures that sea turtles continue to thrive as an ecological, cultural, and spiritual treasure for generations to come.\n\nMeet our team to learn more about the scientists and collaborators behind this work.",

As an example, we will change the “/content/Hardware.qmd” file. First, read the information in the page to understand the intended content. To start, we will organize different subheadings within this page.\nIdentify Sub-Headings. In this example, we will want to identify different types of Hardware used by our particular lab. In this example, we will want the following categories: “PAM Gliders”, “Drifting Recorders”, “Towed Arrays”, and “Handheld Hydrophones”.\n\nUsing the Source editor, use # to indicate Heading 1 style, ## for Heading 2 Style, etc.\nUsing the Visual editor, use the dropdown menu to select the Heading Style\n\nAdd Content. Most content will consist of text, with some images, hyperlinks, and occasional tables. To start, we recommend identifying the content you would like to put in there, and identify the Point of Contact (POC). As an example, we may put the following text:\nPOC: Jane Doe. General description of Hardware, links to online content (vendor specification page, relevant online content), instructions for build or maintain hardware (or links to that information), links to inventory, etc.\nOnce your outline is developed, fill in the content. IF someone else will collate the content– they can create it in a separate document to be copied/pasted here, or they can directly modify this page.\nIf you find you need separate pages for each sub-heading (instead of one long subheading), then create New Content, and link the new content to the _quarto.yml.\nWhen you are finished modifying your document and Project, push changes to Github using Github Desktop (see instructions here)."

    "text": "This is a template for a simple Quarto website (type: website). It looks like a html book (type: book) but unlike the book type it only has html format and you will not have the download options. type: website is a common format for documentation.\nThe repo includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The webpage will use the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nWarning: Check that the settings will allow the GitHub Action to run. See the instructions below under “GitHub Set-up”. Scroll down to the troubleshooting section if the website is not built by the GitHub Action.\nNote: The GitHub Action installs R so you can render qmd files with R code. You will need to edit to install Python or Julia if your qmd uses those instead. If you have substantial computations, you don’t want to be re-running all the computations for files that didn’t change. Read about the freeze option for this situation. R users with complex reports with dependencies (so qmd B depends on qmd A or data file A) should be aware of the {targets} package which will help you keep track of files that need to be re-rendered due to changes in dependencies.\n\n\n\nClick the green “Use This Template” button to make a repository with this content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn’t work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch). \nTurn on GitHub Pages under Settings &gt; Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory. \nAllow GitHub Actions under Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General \nAllow GitHub Actions to write to the gh-pages branch. Scroll to the bottom under Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General, and make sure “Read and Write” is selected. \nEdit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage. When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the Settings &gt; Pages page to find the url to the Quarto website\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the qmd or md files in the content folder. qmd files can include code (R, Python, Julia) and lots of Quarto markdown bells and whistles (like call-outs, cross-references, auto-citations and much more).\nAdd the files to _quarto.yml\n\n\n\n\nThe most common trouble users run into is that the book is not rendering. Check the following:\n\nThe gh-pages branch does not exist. If you forgot to check the check box to include all the branches when you created the repo from the template then it won’t exist. The Action will fail if the gh-pages branch does not already exist. You can create the branch and then push a change to main to trigger the Action to run again.\nThe GitHub Pages has not been set.

The GitHub Action install R since I used that in code.qmd. If you use Python or Julia instead, then you will need to update the GitHub Action to install those.\nIf getting the GitHub Action to work is too much hassle (and that definitely happens), you can alway render locally and publish to the gh-pages branch. If you do this, make sure to delete or rename the GitHub Action to something like\nrender-and-publish.old_yml\nso GitHub does not keep trying to run it. Nothing bad will happen if you don’t do this, but if you are not using the action (because it keeps failing), then you don’t need GitHub to run it."
