It looks like a html book (type: book) but unlike the book type it only has html format and you will not have the download options. type: website is a common format for documentation.\nThe repo includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The webpage will use the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nWarning: Check that the settings will allow the GitHub Action to run. See the instructions below under “GitHub Set-up”. Scroll down to the troubleshooting section if the website is not built by the GitHub Action.\nNote: The GitHub Action installs R so you can render qmd files with R code. You will need to edit to install Python or Julia if your qmd uses those instead. If you have substantial computations, you don’t want to be re-running all the computations for files that didn’t change. Read about the freeze option for this situation. R users with complex reports with dependencies (so qmd B depends on qmd A or data file A) should be aware of the {targets} package which will help you keep track of files that need to be re-rendered due to changes in dependencies.\n\n\n\nClick the green “Use This Template” button to make a repository with this content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn’t work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch). \nTurn on GitHub Pages under Settings &gt; Pages .

    "text": "Who We Are\n\n\n\nMTBAP Area of Research\n\n\nThe Marine Turtle Biology and Assessment Program (MTBAP) conducts research throughout the Pacific Ocean to support the conservation and management of threatened and endangered sea turtle populations.\nWe study sea turtle species that live in the North Pacific Ocean during one or more life stages, from hatchling to adult. This includes green, loggerhead, olive ridley, leatherback, and hawksbill turtles, all protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.\nOur work is guided by species-specific recovery plans and conducted in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, other agencies, and community partners. The knowledge we generate informs management decisions and drives conservation actions across the Pacific Islands Region.\n\n\n\nWhat We Do\nOur primary goal is to understand, assess, and monitor sea turtle populations in the Pacific to support management needs and recovery goals mandated by the Endangered Species Act and other federal statutes.\nWe achieve this by:\n\nConducting field and laboratory research to investigate sea turtle health, ecology, and life history\n\nDesigning geospatial models that integrate population, ecological, satellite, and climate data\n\nProviding data streams, research infrastructure, and scientific leadership across the Pacific\n\n\n\n\nAreas of Research\nOur projects focus on the biological health, ecology, and threats to sea turtle populations, including:\n\nPopulation abundance estimates across Hawaiʻi, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and other U.S. Pacific Territories\n\nClimate change effects on sea turtle populations and their habitats\n\nMovement patterns and habitat use\n\nFisheries impacts and bycatch reduction\n\nHealth consequences of tumor-forming diseases such as fibropapillomatosis\n\nPhysiology and resource requirements\n\nNesting and foraging ecology\n\nThreat assessments across life stages\n\n\n\n\nSuccess Story: Green Turtles in Hawaiʻi\n\n\n\nSea Turtles Studied by MTBAP\n\n\nOne of the clearest examples of conservation impact is the recovery of the green turtle, or honu, in Hawaiʻi.\nWhen our studies began in the 1970s, green turtle populations were severely depleted. Today, thanks to decades of conservation regulations and informed management, our monitoring data shows that Hawaiʻi’s honu are steadily rebounding and are now commonly seen in coastal waters.\n\n\n\nRescue and Rehabilitation\nSince 1990, our team has worked with non-profit, community, and educational partners to rescue, rehabilitate, and release over 1,000 turtles throughout the Hawaiian Islands.\nThe most common causes of stranding are:\n\nFibropapillomatosis (tumor-forming disease)\n\nFisheries interactions (entanglement in fishing line or nets)\n\nInjuries from boat strikes or shark attacks\n\nThrough rescue efforts, we not only save individual turtles but also collect valuable data on the threats affecting sea turtle populations.\n\n\n\nPartnerships\nPartnerships are a fundamental component of our work and essential to the success of sea turtle research throughout the Pacific.\n\n\nFederal & NOAA\n\nPacific Islands Regional Office (PIRO)\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)\nU.S. Geological Survey (USGS)\n\n\n\nState and Territorial\n\nCNMI Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR)\nGuam Department of Agriculture, Division of Aquatic & Wildlife Resources (DAWR)\nCNMI Department of Lands and Natural Resources (DLNR)\nGuam Port Police\nPapahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument Monument Management Board (PMNM MMB)\nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA)\nAmerican Samoa Department of Marine and Wildlife Resources (DMWR)\n\n\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nNAVFAC Marianas\nNAVFAC Hawaiʻi\nNaval Base Guam\nJoint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam\nMarine Corps Base Hawaiʻi\nAndersen Airforce Base\n\n\n\nEducational Institutions\n\nThe University of the South Pacific\nUniversity of Hawaiʻi (CIMAR)\nUniversity of Guam\nHawaiʻi Pacific University\nHawaiʻi Preparatory Academy\nUniversity of Florida\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst\n\n\n\nNon-Profit & Community\n\nPapahānaumokuākea Native Hawaiian Cultural Working Group\nMaui Ocean Center Marine Institute (MOCMI)\nHawaiʻi Marine Animal Response (HMAR)\nHawaiʻi Island Hawksbill Project\nHawaiʻi Wildlife Fund\nMālama i nā Honu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the Numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n5 sea turtle species studied in the North Pacific\n\n50+ years of long-term monitoring\n\n1,000+ turtles rescued and rehabilitated\n\nResearch conducted across Hawaiʻi, Guam, CNMI, American Samoa, and other U.S. Pacific Islands\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nBy studying population dynamics, evaluating threats, and supporting rehabilitation, MTBAP ensures that sea turtles continue to thrive as an ecological, cultural, and spiritual treasure for generations to come.",

As an example, we will change the “/content/Hardware.qmd” file. First, read the information in the page to understand the intended content. To start, we will organize different subheadings within this page.\nIdentify Sub-Headings. In this example, we will want to identify different types of Hardware used by our particular lab. In this example, we will want the following categories: “PAM Gliders”, “Drifting Recorders”, “Towed Arrays”, and “Handheld Hydrophones”.\n\nUsing the Source editor, use # to indicate Heading 1 style, ## for Heading 2 Style, etc.\nUsing the Visual editor, use the dropdown menu to select the Heading Style\n\nAdd Content. Most content will consist of text, with some images, hyperlinks, and occasional tables. To start, we recommend identifying the content you would like to put in there, and identify the Point of Contact (POC). As an example, we may put the following text:\nPOC: Jane Doe. General description of Hardware, links to online content (vendor specification page, relevant online content), instructions for build or maintain hardware (or links to that information), links to inventory, etc.\nOnce your outline is developed, fill in the content. IF someone else will collate the content– they can create it in a separate document to be copied/pasted here, or they can directly modify this page.\nIf you find you need separate pages for each sub-heading (instead of one long subheading), then create New Content, and link the new content to the _quarto.yml.\nWhen you are finished modifying your document and Project, push changes to Github using Github Desktop (see instructions here)."

    "text": "Meet the Marine Turtle Biology and Assessment Program (MTBAP) team.\n\n\nDr. Summer Martin\nProgram Lead\n\nDr. Martin conducts ecological research to support marine turtle population assessments and sustainable fisheries management. Her current research includes modeling spatial habitat use from animal-borne instruments, modeling climate-related impacts on marine turtle populations, quantifying fisheries bycatch interactions, and analyzing programmatic and archived data to understand habitat use and migration patterns. She conducts field research throughout the Pacific Islands Region and serves as Chief Scientist on research missions. Dr. Martin also contributes to population assessments, species status reviews, and critical habitat designations under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).\n\n\nShawn Murakawa\nResearch Biologist \nShawn is a biologist in the Marine Turtle Biology and Assessment Program at NOAA’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. She leads nesting and in-water survey research at Rose Atoll, manages the skeletochronology laboratory, and studies growth rates and aging of sea turtles. Born and raised on Oʻahu, Shawn earned her B.S. and M.S. in Animal Sciences from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. She has participated in expeditions to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and American Samoa and supported stranding response during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Outside of NOAA, she volunteers with Nā Kama Kai and Kapiʻolani Medical Center, and enjoys fishing, family time, and raising succulents.\n\n\nDr. Camryn Allen\nWildlife Endocrinologist \nDr. Allen is a wildlife endocrinologist who uses molecular approaches to address demographic and habitat utilization questions critical for conservation of endangered wildlife populations. She is a research scientist with the Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research at NOAA Fisheries’ Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. Dr. Allen developed the sea turtle endocrinology laboratory at PIFSC to examine sex ratios of turtles at foraging grounds and also uses stable isotope analysis to understand habitat use, connectivity, and human impacts on Pacific sea turtle populations.\n\n\nMarylou Staman\nMarine Biologist \n(Placeholder — bio to be added.)\n\n\nDr. Alexander R. Gaos\nResearch Ecologist \nDr. Gaos is a Research Ecologist with MTBAP at NOAA’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center. He specializes in deploying satellite telemetry, applying molecular genetic tools, and developing field programs across the Pacific. He serves as Vice-Chair of the Eastern Pacific Region for the IUCN Marine Turtle Specialist Group, Travel Grant Chair for the International Sea Turtle Society, and Co-Founder of the Eastern Pacific Hawksbill Initiative (ICAPO). With over a decade of experience, he has managed nesting beach surveys, in-water monitoring, and fisheries bycatch reduction programs across the Pacific. Dr. Gaos earned his M.S. in Biology from San Diego State University and his Ph.D. in Ecology through the SDSU/UC Davis Joint Doctoral Program.\n\n\nJan-Willem Staman\nBiological Science Technician \nJan Willem Staman is a Biological Science Technician with MTBAP. He leads the MTBAP stranding response network across the Main Hawaiian Islands and organizes and leads in-water research missions on Oahu, Guam, and the Northern Marianas. When not in the field Jan Willem works on data validation, necropsies, and sample archiving. Where possible, he also supports other Protected Species Programs and the Ecosystems Science Division by conducting fish surveys throughout the Pacific Islands Region.\n\n\nAndrew Glinsky\nField Technician\n Andrew is from upstate New York and holds degrees from Towson University and Stonybrook University. Over the last decade, he has been part of sea turtle programs in Costa Rica, West Africa, the Caribbean, Australia, and the United States. While abroad he was fortunate to work with multiple species of sea turtles, assist in predator deterrent projects, and help conduct a variety of biological surveys monitoring primates, small mammals, and reptiles. Andrew has been part of CIMAR/NOAA for four field seasons, working with marine turtles at a remote field camp in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.\n\n\nShelbie Ishimaru\nGraduate Assistant\n Shelbie Ishimaru is a Graduate Assistant for the Marine Turtle Biology and Assessment Program (MTBAP). She is currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where her doctoral research focuses on developing mark-recapture models to estimate abundance of the Hawaiian green sea turtle population. Along with modeling efforts, she has supported field research and data collection in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. Born and raised in Oʻahu, she began working with MTBAP as a Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center Young Scientist Opportunity intern. Shelbie earned her B.S. in Environmental Science and Management from the University of California, Davis.\n\n\nJosefa Munoz\nGraduate Assistant\n Growing up in CHamoru culture, Josefa “Sefa” Muñoz learned the importance of respect and stewardship for the natural world—values that inspired her journey into scientific research and conservation. She began as a Haggan Watch volunteer in 2014 while obtaining her B.S. in Biology at the University of Guam and became a sea turtle biologist by 2018, deepening her passion to protect and study Guam’s data-deficient, endangered green sea turtles. Now a University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Ph.D. candidate and MTBAP Graduate Assistant supported through CIMAR, Sefa’s dissertation focuses on establishing baseline information on Mariana Archipelago nesting green sea turtles, including their demography, mating strategies and breeding sex ratios, inter-nesting movements, post-nesting migrations, and foraging habitat use. To investigate these questions, she uses satellite telemetry, genetics, and stable isotope analysis. From classrooms to fishing piers, Sefa enjoys sharing her research and turtle experiences, fostering connections between science and the community. She is a former fellow of NOAA’s Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center’s Quantitative Ecology and Socioeconomics Training (QUEST) Program and a member of the IUCN Marine Turtle Specialist Group–Oceania.",
