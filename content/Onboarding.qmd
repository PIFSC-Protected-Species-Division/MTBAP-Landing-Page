   - Covers workplace safety protocols.  

3. Review [Cyber Security Responsibilities](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/pifsc-intranet/operations-management-and-information-division/its-branch/information-technology-services-its/responsibilities)  
   - Outlines NOAA data security policies.  

4. If you require lab access, complete the [Laboratory User Agreement](/content/forms/LaboratoryUserAgreement.pdf).  
   - Further instructions can be found on [our Google site](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/pifsc-labs).  
   - After completing these items, schedule a lab orientation walk-through with Kerry Reardon or Justin Weeks.
