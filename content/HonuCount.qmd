Since the inception of the Honu Count in 2017, nearly 600 citizens reported 688 sightings of 253 individual turtles. This valuable scientific information is used to track recently rehabilitated turtles, resident turtle habitat use, or when nesting turtles from Lalo return back to their foraging grounds. We also use the data collected from Honu Count to determine the resilience of the Hawaiian green sea turtle in the face of climate change.
