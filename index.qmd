## Who are we?
The Marine Turtle Biology and Assessment Program, housed within NOAA's Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center, aims to better understand, assess, and monitor sea turtle populations in the Pacific to support management needs and species recovery goals, as mandated through the Endangered Species Act and other federal statutes.
